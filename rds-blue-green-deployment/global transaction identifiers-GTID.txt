Global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) are unique identifiers generated for committed MySQL transactions. 
You can use GTIDs to make binlog replication simpler and easier to troubleshoot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MySQL uses two different types of transactions for binlog replication:

GTID transactions – Transactions that are identified by a GTID.

Anonymous transactions – Transactions that don't have a GTID assigned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a replication configuration, GTIDs are unique across all DB instances.

GTIDs simplify replication configuration because when you use them, you don't have to refer to log file positions.

GTIDs also make it easier to track replicated transactions and determine whether the source instance and replicas are consistent.

You can use GTID-based replication to replicate data with RDS for MySQL read replicas.

You can configure GTID-based replication when you are creating new read replicas, 
or you can convert existing read replicas to use GTID-based replication.

You can also use GTID-based replication in a delayed replication configuration with RDS for MySQL.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gtid_mode:
              
OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE, ON

OFF 
specifies that new transactions are anonymous transactions (that is, don't have GTIDs), 
and a transaction must be anonymous to be replicated.

OFF_PERMISSIVE
specifies that new transactions are anonymous transactions, but all transactions can be replicated.

ON_PERMISSIVE 
specifies that new transactions are GTID transactions, but all transactions can be replicated.

ON 
specifies that new transactions are GTID transactions, and a transaction must be a GTID transaction to be replicated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
enforce_gtid_consistency:

OFF, ON, WARN

OFF 
allows transactions to violate GTID consistency.

ON 
prevents transactions from violating GTID consistency.

WARN 
allows transactions to violate GTID consistency but generates a warning when a violation occurs.

####################################NOTE#####################################################################
In the AWS Management Console, the gtid_mode parameter appears as gtid-mode.

############################################################################################################
##################To enable GTID-based replication for new read replicas####################################
Make sure that the parameter group associated with the DB instance has the following parameter settings:

gtid_mode – ON or ON_PERMISSIVE

enforce_gtid_consistency – ON

If you changed the parameter group of the DB instance, reboot the DB instance. 

Create one or more read replicas of the DB instance.

########################### GTID-based replication for existing read replicas ######################################

For an existing MySQL DB instance with read replicas that doesn't use GTID-based repl ication, you can configure GTID-based replication
between the DB instance and the read replicas.
