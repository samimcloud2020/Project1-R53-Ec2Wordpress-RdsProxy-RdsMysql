A switchover promotes the green environment to be the new production environment.

When the green DB instance has read replicas, they are also promoted. 

            -------------BEFORE SWITCHOVER-------------------

Before you switch over, production traffic is routed to the DB instance and read replicas in the blue environment.
            -----------AFETR SWITCHOVER----------------------

After you switch over, production traffic is routed to the DB instance and read replicas in the green environment.
####################################Switchover timeout ############################################################################
specify a switchover timeout period between 30 seconds and 3,600 seconds (one hour). 

If the switchover takes longer than the specified duration, then any changes are rolled back and no changes are made to either environment. 

The default timeout period is 300 seconds (five minutes). <-----------
####################################################Switchover guardrails ######################################################
When you start a switchover, Amazon RDS runs some basic checks to test the readiness of the blue and green environments for switchover. 

These checks are known as switchover guardrails. 

These switchover guardrails prevent a switchover if the environments aren't ready for it. 

Therefore, they avoid longer than expected downtime and prevent the loss of data between the blue and green environments
that might result if the switchover started.
#############Amazon RDS runs the following guardrail checks on the green environment: ##################################
Replication health –
     Check if green primary DB instance replication status is healthy. 
     The green primary DB instance is a replica of the blue primary DB instance.

Replication lag – 
    Check if the replica lag of the green primary DB instance is within allowable limits for switchover. 
    The allowable limits are based on the specified timeout period.
    Replica lag indicates how far the green primary DB instance is lagging behind its blue primary DB instance.
    Replica lag indicates how much time the green replica might require before it catches up with its blue source.

Active writes – 
  Make sure there are no active writes on the green primary DB instance.
##################Amazon RDS runs the following guardrail checks on the blue environment:###########################
External replication – 
    Make sure the blue primary DB instance isn't the target of external replication to prevent writes 
    on the blue primary DB instance during switchover.

Long-running active writes – 
    Make sure there are no long-running active writes on the blue primary DB instance because they can increase replica lag.

Long-running DDL statements – 
    Make sure there are no long-running DDL statements on the blue primary DB instance because they can increase replica lag.

################Switchover actions ##############################################################################
##########When you switch over a blue/green deployment, RDS performs the following actions:##############################
Runs guardrail checks to verify if the blue and green environments are ready for switchover.

Stops new write operations on the primary DB instance in both environments.

Drops connections to the DB instances in both environments and doesn't allow new connections.

Waits for replication to catch up in the green environment so that the green environment is in sync with the blue environment.

Renames the DB instances in the both environments.

RDS renames the DB instances in the green environment to match the corresponding DB instances in the blue environment.
    EX:
    Assume the name of a DB instance in the blue environment is mydb. 
    Also assume the name of the corresponding DB instance in the green environment is mydb-green-abc123. 
    During switchover, the name of the DB instance in the green environment is changed to mydb.

RDS renames the DB instances in the blue environment by appending -oldn to the current name, where n is a number. 
    EX:
    Assume the name of a DB instance in the blue environment is mydb. After switchover, the DB instance name might be mydb-old1.

RDS also renames the endpoints in the green environment to match the corresponding endpoints in the blue environment 
so that application changes aren't required.

Allows connections to databases in both environments.

Allows write operations on the primary DB instance in the new production environment.

After switchover, the previous production primary DB instance only allows read operations until it is rebooted.

You can monitor the status of a switchover using Amazon EventBridge. <--------

If you have tags configured in the blue environment, these tags are moved to the new production environment during switchover. 
The previous production environment also retains these tags.

If the switchover starts and then stops before finishing for any reason, then any changes are rolled back,
and no changes are made to either environment.
########################Switchover best practices ###########################################################
Thoroughly test the resources in the green environment. Make sure they function properly and efficiently.

Monitor relevant Amazon CloudWatch metrics. 
    ReplicaLag – 
        Use this metric to identify the current replication lag on the green environment. 
        To reduce downtime, make sure that this value is close to zero before you switch over.

    DatabaseConnections – 
        Use this metric to estimate the level of activity on the blue/green deployment, 
        and make sure that the value is at an acceptable level for your deployment before you switch over. 
        If Performance Insights is turned on, DBLoad is a more accurate metric.
Identify the best time for the switchover.

Make sure the DB instances in both environments are in Available state.

Make sure the primary DB instance in the green environment is healthy and replicating.

Make sure that your network and client configurations don’t increase the DNS cache Time-To-Live (TTL) beyond five seconds,
which is the default for RDS DNS zones.
Otherwise, applications will continue to send write traffic to the blue environment after  switchover.

Make sure data loading is complete before switching over. 
        Handling lazy loading when you create a blue/green deployment

During a switchover, you can't modify any DB instances included in the switchover.
