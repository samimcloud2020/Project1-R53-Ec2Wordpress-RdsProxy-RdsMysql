Avoid using non-transactional storage engines, such as MyISAM, that aren't optimized for replication.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimize read replicas for binary log replication.

if your DB engine version supports it, consider using GTID replication, parallel replication,
and crash-safe replication in your production environment before deploying your blue/green deployment. 

These options promote consistency and durability of your data before you switch over your blue/green deployment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thoroughly test the DB instances in the green environment before switching over.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep your databases in the green environment read only. 

We recommend that you enable write operations on the green environment with caution because they can result in replication conflicts.

They can also result in unintended data in the production databases after switchover.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When using a blue/green deployment to implement schema changes, make only replication-compatible changes.

EX:
you can add new columns at the end of a table, create indexes, or drop indexes without 
disrupting replication from the blue deployment to the green deployment.

However, schema changes, such as renaming columns or renaming tables, break binary log replication to the green deployment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After you create the blue/green deployment, handle lazy loading if necessary. Make sure data loading is complete before switching over.
