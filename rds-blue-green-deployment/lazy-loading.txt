-------------------Handling lazy loading when you create a blue/green deployment-------------------------------

When you create a blue/green deployment, Amazon RDS creates the primary DB instance in the green environment 
by restoring from a DB snapshot. 

After it is created, the green DB instance continues to load data in the background, which is known as lazy loading.

If the DB instance has read replicas, these are also created from DB snapshots and are subject to lazy loading.

If you access data that hasn't been loaded yet, the DB instance immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, 
and then continues loading the rest of the data in the background. 

To help mitigate the effects of lazy loading on tables to which you require quick access,
you can perform operations that involve full-table scans, such as SELECT *. 
This operation allows Amazon RDS to download all of the backed-up table data from S3.

If an application attempts to access data that isn't loaded, the application can encounter higher latency 
than normal while the data is loaded. 
This higher latency due to lazy loading could lead to poor performance for latency-sensitive workloads.

Important
If you switch over a blue/green deployment before data loading is complete,
your application could experience performance issues due to high latency.
