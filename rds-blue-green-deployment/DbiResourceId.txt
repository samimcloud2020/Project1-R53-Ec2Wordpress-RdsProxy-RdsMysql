Amazon RDS tracks resources in blue/green deployments with the DbiResourceId of each resource.

This resource ID is an AWS Region-unique, immutable identifier for the resource.

The resource ID is separate from the DB instance ID:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dbInstanceId   & ResourceId (DbiResourceId)  are different.


The name (instance ID) of a resource changes when you switch over a blue/green deployment,
but each resource keeps the same resource ID.

EX:
A DB instance identifier might be mydb in the blue environment.
After switchover, the same DB instance might be renamed to mydb-old1. 
However, the resource ID of the DB instance doesn't change during switchover. 

So, when the green resources are promoted to be the new production resources, 
their resource IDs don't match the blue resource IDs that were previously in production.
